    "body": "2023/04/17 - Fasten Health, the innovative healthcare platform that empowers patients to take control of their medical records, is proud to announce several exciting new features and upgrades that have been added to the platform in the past month. Fasten Health now supports almost 10000 healthcare institutions, with thousands more expected to join in the coming months. Patients can easily connect with their personal accounts, importing their electronic medical records for seamless integration with the Fasten Health platform. And for those who want to test the platform without using real data, Sandbox credentials filled with syntheticallycreated test data are still available. But that’s not all! Fasten Health has also introduced several other new features designed to enhance the patient experience. Patients can now manually enter their medical records using a helpful form that includes fields for conditions, medications, practitioners, locations/organizations, surgeries/procedures, and more. Additionally, patients can upload documentation such as PDFs and notes, as well as medical imaging results in DICOM format. Fasten Health has also added patient-friendly descriptions for medical codes such as LOINC/SNOMED, providing valuable context that helps patients better understand their medical history. Other recent upgrades include the addition of branding logos and homepages for many sources, making it easier for patients to recognize their providers. Provider search has also been enhanced with pagination, full-text search, and filtering by tags (coming soon). Fasten Health has also fixed some broken healthcare institutions, including Aetna, Anthem/BlueCross, and Kaiser Permanente (coming soon). The company has also launched a new blog at https://www. fastenhealth. com and created a policy repository at https://github. com/fastenhealth/policy, where users can view changes to the platform’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Finally, we’re excited to announce that our founder Jason Kulatunga will be presenting a talk at the DevDays 2023 conference in Amsterdam. The presentation, titled “Using Graph-theory to Empower Patients and answer questions,” will explore how Fasten Health (and other developers) can leverage Graph Theory help patients answer the questionsthat actually matter to them. If you’ll be attending DevDays 2023, we’d love to meet you and chat about Fasten Health and patient empowerment. We’re thrilled to be offering these exciting new features and upgrades to the Fasten Health platform,and we look forward to continuing to improve the patient experience. Stay tuned for more updates!

    "body": "2023/03/15 - Fasten Health, the open-source personal/family electronic medical record aggregator, has made significantstrides in the past month. The team has been working tirelessly to bring you new and improved features that make the platform even more useful for you and your family’s healthcare needs. The most notable update is the expansion of the Fasten Health network. The platform now supports almost 6000 healthcare institutions, with thousands more on the way. This means you can connect your personal accounts and import your own electronic medical records from a vast array of sources. If you’re just testing out the platform, you can continue to use Sandbox credentials, full of synthetically created test data. Another exciting new feature is the ability to manually enter your medical records using our helpful form. This includes information about your conditions, medications, practitioners, locations/organizations, surgeries/procedures, and more. For patients in the US, these fields support auto-complete using data from National Practitioners Database (Locations/Practitioners/Organizations), National Library of Medicine (Medication and Procedures), and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (Conditions). In addition, Fasten Health has added branding logos and homepages for many sources, making it easier to recognize your provider. The platform’s provider search feature has also been enhanced, adding pagination, full text search, and filtering by tags (coming soon). The team is continually working on further improvements to Fasten Health, and the next few months promise to be even more exciting. Uploading documentation (PDFs, notes, etc. ) and medical imaging results (DICOM) are coming soon. Fasten Health is committed to delivering an open-source, self-hosted personal/family electronic medical record aggregator designed to integrate with thousands of insurances/hospitals/clinics. We believe that healthcare should be accessible to everyone, and Fasten Health is our way of contributing to that vision. If you haven’t tried Fasten Health yet, what are you waiting for?

    "title": "An Open-Source Personal Health Record",
    "body": "2022/09/22 - We all have a medical history that we want to keep secure and confidential. But what happens when our medical history is scattered across multiple healthcare providers? It can be difficult to keep track of everything, especially when we need to transfer information between providers. This is where Fasten Health comes in. Fasten Health is an open-source, self-hosted, personal/family electronic medical record aggregator. It is designed to integrate with thousands of insurance companies, hospital networks, clinics, and labs. Fasten Health is built to ensure that everybody can have a single, private location to store your medical records. Fasten Health was born out of the my own personal experience. Like many of us, I have had multiple health, vision, and dental insurance providers over my career, and visited many different clinics, hospitals, and labs to get procedures and tests done. When I had a semi-serious medical issue, I realized that my medical history was much more complicated than I had realized and was distributed across the various healthcare providers I’d used over the years. I wanted a single, private location to store my medical records but couldn’t find any software that met myneeds. I decided to build Fasten Health to solve this problem for myself and all of you. It’s designed to be self-hosted and offline, ensuring that your medical history remains private and secure. It uses the healthcare industry’s semi-standard FHIR protocol and Smart-on-FHIR (OAuth2) authentication, which means no passwords are necessary. Fasten Health is designed for families, not clinics, and supportsmulti-user access for household and family use. While it’s still a work-in-progress and can only communicate with a limited number of healthcare institutions, Fasten Health is a promising solution for those looking for a way to securely connect their healthcare providers and create a personal health record that never leaves their hands. In addition to its current features, Fasten Health is designed with an easily extensible core around a solid foundation. Future versions of Fasten Health will support customizable dashboards and tracking for diagnostic tests, as well as integration with smart devices and wearables. Overall, Fasten Health is a great solution for those looking for a personal health record aggregator that is secure, private, and easily accessible. It is open-source and designed for contributions and auditing. If you’re interested in staying up-to-date on Fasten Health’s progress, be sure to join our mailing list. "
