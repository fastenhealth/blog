We've just released v1.0.0 of [Fasten Health](https://github.com/fastenhealth/fasten-onprem)!

> Just a refresher: [1 year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/xj9rx7/introducing_fasten_a_selfhosted_personal/) I announced **Fasten, an open-source, self-hosted, personal/family electronic medical record aggregator (PHR), designed to integrate with 100,000's of insurances/hospitals & clinics**.
>
> It securely connects patient healthcare providers together, creating a personal health record that never leaves the patient's hands without their consent.

> Here's a couple of screenshots that'll remind you what it looks like:
