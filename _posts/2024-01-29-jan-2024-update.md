Now that v1 is out the door, I wanted to give everyone an update on the progress we're making on our [Q1 roadmap](https://docs.fastenhealth.com/roadmap)

### **üéâ ü•≥ Fasten Health is now available in the App Store! üéâ ü•≥**

- After almost 3 months of beta testing, and almost a dozen test releases, the Fasten Health desktop app is now available in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fasten-health/id6471036301)!
- You no longer need to understand Docker, Github or how to run a home server. With a single click you can have the app running on your computer. This unlocks Fasten for older parents & non-technologists who don't have a way to manage their records.

### Import from HealthVault/Lydia

- If you were previously a user of Microsoft Health Vault or Lydia, you can now easily migrate to Fasten Health. Fasten now has CCDA Support - Powered by [Health Samurai](https://www.health-samurai.io/)'s converter.
- The converter, while not open source, runs on Fasten Health, Inc.'s infrastructure with no data sent back to Health Samurai during conversion.

### **New Fasten Sources Editor: [https://toolbox.fastenhealth.com/](https://toolbox.fastenhealth.com/)**

- You can now [easily contribute corrections](https://toolbox.fastenhealth.com/) to providers in our catalog by submitting updates for logos, institution names/aliases, and websites.
