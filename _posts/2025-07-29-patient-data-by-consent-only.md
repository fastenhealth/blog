Fasten Health is renewing our annual commitment to the CARIN Alliance Code of Conduct, reinforcing our stance that trust 
isn’t optional, it’s required infrastructure.

The [CARIN Code of Conduct](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66635361bd8176cd6413cb12/66635361bd8176cd6413cbfb_CARIN_Code_of_Conduct_2023.pdf) 
outlines key principles for consumer-directed exchange, including:

- Clear, patient-directed consent
- No secondary use without approval
- Understandable privacy policies
- The ability to revoke access and delete data
- Full transparency in the event of data misuse

## Why does this matter?
Under HIPAA, data sharing is governed by strict regulatory protections. But when a patient directs their data to a third 
party, HIPAA often no longer applies. Instead, the only safeguards are a company’s privacy policy and terms of use—many of 
which are opaque or overly permissive. They're also living documents, that change over time, with little to no notice for patients.

The CARIN Code fills that gap. It offers a trust framework for companies handling patient-directed data exchange, ensuring 
patients aren’t **unknowingly** giving up control of their records.

We designed Fasten Health around these same principles. Every connection made through our platform is patient-initiated, 
traceable, and governed by explicit consent. And we only work with partners who share that standard.

Consumer-directed exchange should empower patients—not expose them. That’s why we’re proud to stand with the CARIN Alliance 
and help operationalize their vision for ethical, interoperable health data access.
