We all have a medical history that we want to keep secure and confidential. 
But what happens when our medical history is scattered across multiple healthcare providers? 
It can be difficult to keep track of everything, especially when we need to transfer information 
between providers. This is where Fasten Health comes in.

Fasten Health is an open-source, self-hosted, personal/family electronic medical record aggregator. 
It is designed to integrate with thousands of insurance companies, hospital networks, clinics, and 
labs. Fasten Health is built to ensure that everybody can have a single, private location to store 
your medical records.

Fasten Health was born out of the my own personal experience. Like many of us, I have 
had multiple health, vision, and dental insurance providers over my career, and visited many different clinics, 
hospitals, and labs to get procedures and tests done. When I had a semi-serious medical 
issue, I realized that my medical history was much more complicated than I had realized 
and was distributed across the various healthcare providers I'd used over the years. I wanted a 
single, private location to store my medical records but couldn't find any software that met my
needs. 

I decided to build Fasten Health to solve this problem for myself and all of you.
It's designed to be self-hosted and offline, ensuring that your medical history remains private and secure. 
It uses the healthcare industry's semi-standard FHIR protocol and Smart-on-FHIR (OAuth2) authentication, 
which means no passwords are necessary. Fasten Health is designed for families, not clinics, and supports
multi-user access for household and family use.

While it's still a work-in-progress and can only communicate with a limited number of healthcare 
institutions, Fasten Health is a promising solution for those looking for a way to securely connect 
their healthcare providers and create a personal health record that never leaves their hands.

In addition to its current features, Fasten Health is designed with an easily extensible core around 
a solid foundation. Future versions of Fasten Health will support customizable dashboards and tracking for diagnostic 
tests, as well as integration with smart devices and wearables.

Overall, Fasten Health is a great solution for those looking for a personal health record aggregator 
that is secure, private, and easily accessible. It is open-source and designed for contributions and 
auditing. If you're interested in staying up-to-date on Fasten Health's progress, be sure to join our [mailing list](https://forms.gle/SNsYX9BNMXB6TuTw6).
