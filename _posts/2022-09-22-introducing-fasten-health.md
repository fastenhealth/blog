We all have a medical history that we want to keep secure and confidential. 
But what happens when our medical history is scattered across multiple healthcare providers? 
It can be difficult to keep track of everything, especially when we need to transfer information 
between providers. This is where Fasten Health comes in.

Fasten Health is an open-source, self-hosted, personal/family electronic medical record aggregator. 
It is designed to integrate with thousands of insurance companies, hospital networks, clinics, and 
labs across multiple industries. Fasten Health is built to solve the problem of not having a single, 
private location to store your medical records.

Fasten Health was born out of the founder's own personal experience. Like many of us, the founder 
had multiple health, vision, and dental insurance providers, and visited many different clinics, 
hospitals, and labs to get procedures and tests done. When the founder had a semi-serious medical 
issue, they realized that their medical history was much more complicated than they had realized 
and was distributed across many healthcare providers they had used over the years. They wanted a 
single, private location to store their medical records but couldn't find any software that worked 
as they liked.

Fasten Health is designed to address these concerns. It is self-hosted and offline, ensuring that 
your medical history remains private and secure. It uses the Medical industry's (semi-standard) 
FHIR protocol and OAuth2 (Smart-on-FHIR) authentication, which means no passwords are necessary. 
Fasten Health is designed for families, not clinics, and supports multi-user access for household 
and family use.

While it is still a work-in-progress and can only communicate with a limited number of healthcare 
institutions, Fasten Health is a promising solution for those looking for a way to securely connect 
their healthcare providers and create a personal health record that never leaves their hands.

In addition to its current features, Fasten Health is designed with an easily extensible core around 
a solid foundation. The future vision for Fasten Health includes dashboards and tracking for diagnostic 
tests, as well as integration with smart devices and wearables.

Overall, Fasten Health is a great solution for those looking for a personal health record aggregator 
that is secure, private, and easily accessible. It is open-source and designed for contributions and 
auditing. If you're interested in staying up-to-date on Fasten Health's progress, be sure to fill out
