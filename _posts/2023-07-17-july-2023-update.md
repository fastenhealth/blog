I made a number of significant/breaking changes to Fasten since our 
[last update in May](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/13i68rm/fasten_health_open_source_selfhosted_personal/), 
and I wanted to give you all an update now that we've cut a new release -- `v0.1.2`

- Fasten's query language has changed for the better. After a very productive conversation with Cody from Medplum, I've decided to mimic their solution - extract the FHIR SearchParameters for each resource as they are being stored, and store them beside the raw FHIR resource data. This means querying is more performant with a "well documented" syntax (we'll be using a subset of the FHIR search syntax)
- Fixed a long standing issue when syncing resources with Healthcare institutions. Users with large patient histories would only see a portion of their data in Fasten, as their access token would expire before the sync completed. We've fixed this to refresh tokens even in the middle of the sync.
- Documentation for the Dashboard Configuration & Query language has been started (still a WIP)
    - [https://docs.fastenhealth.com/dashboard/](https://docs.fastenhealth.com/dashboard/ "https://docs.fastenhealth.com/dashboard/")
- Default Widget-based Dashboard can now be overridden with a custom JSON configuration file, allowing users to completely customize their dashboard for their needs/condition.
    - Updated a number of UI libraries to increase usability.
- Fixed some compilation issues related to the [ballooning size of the fasten-sources library](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/14xeqkp/how_to_minimize_ram_usage_during_go_binary/)
- Significant improvements to test coverage -- honestly its kind of nuts how bad it was before :(
- 1000's of user contributed logos and websites for healthcare institutions have been merged into our dataset. I'm incredibly grateful to all of you who contributed!
    - If you'd like to contribute to this effort, you can take a look at the [Fasten Sources Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZSgwfd7kwxSnimk4yofIFcR8ZMUls0zi9SZpRiOJBx0/edit?usp=sharing)


**Now for the not-so-good news:**

- **The database changes in v0.1.x are not backwards compatible with v0.0.x**, meaning that you will need to delete your database if you're persisting it outside of your container (sorry). This means anyone who's used the form to manually create records will lose their data.
- The Dashboard is a bit broken at the moment. Dynamically defined widgets are not displaying/re-rendering correctly, and I'm still trying to figure out why that is.
