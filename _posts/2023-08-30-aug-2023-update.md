Fasten has matured significantly since our [last update in July](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/13i68rm/fasten_health_open_source_selfhosted_personal/), and I wanted to give you all an update:

- **Full-Time Commitment:** I've taken the plunge and committed to working on Fasten Health full-time. This means more updates, improvements, and quicker releases.
- **Expanded Healthcare Network:** Fasten now supports a whopping 25,000+ healthcare institutions, with the recent addition of major platforms like Athena, AllScripts & eClinical/Healow. If you've got some free time, consider contributing by adding homepages and logos for healthcare institutions in our [Google Drive sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZSgwfd7kwxSnimk4yofIFcR8ZMUls0zi9SZpRiOJBx0/edit#gid=1410302844)
- **Customizable Dashboards:** Our user-customizable dashboard feature is now up and running. You can create condition-specific dashboards and even share them with your community using Github Gists. Check out our [documentation link](https://docs.fastenhealth.com/dashboard/philosophy.html) for all the details.
- **Funding and Sustainability:** To ensure Fasten's long-term sustainability, we're exploring some funding options. While we're still deciding a long-term monetization strategy, I'm kicking off with a crowdfunding/fundraising experiment for the first 500 users (including a surprise desktop app):

Thanks for being a part of the Fasten Health journey. Your support has been incredibly humbling and keeps me moving forward!
