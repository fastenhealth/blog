The [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/part-170#p-170.404(b)(1)) requires Certified EHRs to approve Patient Access API requests within:
- **10 business days** to verify an API user’s identity
- **5 business days** after verification to enable the application
Total time: **15 business days max** -- but many developers (including us) **know the wait times are much longer**

## Why does this rule exist?
Before this, API approvals were inconsistent. Some EHRs moved quickly, while others delayed access **for weeks or months**. 
The rule was meant to **streamline approvals** and ensure patients can share their data without **unnecessary friction**.

## So what happens when EHRs don’t comply?
Unfortunately, we still encounter **delays**, **excessive paperwork**, or **vague security reviews**. The real problem? **Patients suffer**. 
A delayed record could mean **missing a clinical trial, waiting longer for a second opinion, or struggling to manage a chronic condition**.

To ensure that patient needs are prioritized, Fasten Health is forced to file [Information Blocking Complaints](https://github.com/fastenhealth/information-blocking-complaints) against EHR vendors --
and nobody wants that.

## How Fasten Health Helps
We’ve experienced these same roadblocks and built a solution to **eliminate them**. 
Instead of forcing businesses to integrate separately with multiple EHRs, Fasten Health provides a **single unified API** already connected to 
40,000+ healthcare institutions. Our API retrieves **patient-mediated health records without the usual delays and inconsistencies**.

**What’s been your experience with Patient Access APIs?**
- How long did your last Patient API integration take?
- What’s the worst excuse you’ve heard for an API delay?
